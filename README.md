# Multiscale COVID-19

## Multiscale Analysis of COVID-19 (MOAC) Spatiotemporal Variations

### 1. Overview
#### This project develops multiscale optimization engineering approach to perform the following tasks:

- To model and forecast the growth (G-rate) in the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases and the associated death rates (D-rate) from the global to continental scales 
- To identify the optimal control measures at the same spatial scales till indiviudal country-level via explainable deep learning with SHAP and clustering analysis

#### In this repository, we share the code and data for our above proposed tasks as part of the Multiscale Optimization Analysis of COVID-19 (MOAC) Spatiotemporal Variations.

### 2. Data Description

Please refer to our shared data folder for information of the datasets (before and after data processing) to perform the above tasks.
