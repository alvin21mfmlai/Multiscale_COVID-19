# Multiscale_COVID-19

## Multiscale Optimization Analysis of COVID-19 (MOAC) Spatiotemporal Variations

### 1. Overview
#### This project develops multiscale optimization engineering approach to perform the following tasks:

- To model and forecast the growth (G-rate) in the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases and the associated death rates (D-rate) from the global to continental scales 
- To identify the optimal control measures at the same spatial scales till indiviudal country-level via explainable deep learning with SHAP and clustering analysis
